# BreakoutC++
This project was created using C++, Gimp, Audacity and SDL through the software Visual Studio 2017. The game has the same mechanics as the breakout game, but with changes in the design, and addition of features to make it feel like a Viking breakout game.
 
 
Credits:
I used parts of codes from https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php. This website has many tutorials to teach how to work with SDL. Some variables and methods of my code could have the same name as the examples provided on it. However, my code structure is completely different.

I used the code provided in this website http://www.danielsoltyka.com/programming/2010/05/30/c-vector2d-rectangle-classes/ that has two structucs: (1) that represents a 2D Vector, with some functionalities; (2)that represents a Rectangle. I made some changes in the code, and added new features such as Vector2D reflection, and the directionals to make my work easier. 

Art: All of the images, sounds and font were obtained from different websites, and they were all free to use, if not for commercial purposes.
